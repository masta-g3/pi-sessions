# pi-agent-hub

Pi-native tmux hub for long-running coding-agent sessions, skills, and MCP.

Use `pi-hub` to keep multiple Pi sessions visible, grouped, restartable, and easy to jump between from one terminal dashboard.

New here? See [Features](docs/FEATURES.md) for the dashboard workflow and core capabilities.

## Why pi-agent-hub?

Most agent managers try to become the runtime. `pi-agent-hub` stays small: Pi runs the agents, tmux keeps them alive, and the hub gives you one keyboard-driven dashboard to manage them.

| Feature | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Pi-native | Uses Pi sessions, extensions, skills, MCP, and project state directly. |
| tmux-native | Sessions keep running as normal tmux sessions; you can attach, switch, or recover manually. |
| One stable dashboard | `pi-hub` always brings you back to the same control center. |
| Return shortcuts | `Ctrl+Q` jumps from a managed session back to the dashboard; `Alt+R` opens rename from inside a session. |
| Project-scoped skills/MCP | Pick skills and MCP servers for the selected session's primary repo. |
| Multi-repo without worktrees | Extra repos are symlinked into a runtime workspace; source repos are not moved or owned. |
| Small surface area | No cloud service, no custom agent runtime, no hidden repo scanning. |

## Quick start

Requirements: Pi and tmux.

```bash
pi install npm:pi-agent-hub
pi-hub doctor
pi-hub
```

Inside the dashboard:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `n` | Create a new Pi session |
| `Enter` | Open or switch to the selected session |
| `/` | Filter sessions |
| `p` | Send a one-line message to the selected live session without opening it |
| `?` | Show help and status legend |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Return from a managed session to the dashboard |
| `r` / `R` | Rename or restart the selected session |
| `g` / `G` | Move a session to a group or rename its group |
| `K` / `J` | Move the selected session up/down within its group |
| `s` / `m` | Pick project skills or MCP servers |

## Install notes

The npm package is still `pi-agent-hub`; it exposes both commands, with `pi-hub` as the shorter daily-use command and `pi-agent-hub` kept for compatibility.

For local development, see [Development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Common commands

```bash
pi-hub              # create/attach/switch to the dashboard tmux session
pi-hub tui          # run the TUI directly in the current terminal
pi-hub doctor
pi-hub list
pi-hub add . -t api -g default
pi-hub add ./api -t fullstack --add-cwd ../web --add-cwd ../shared
pi-hub delete <session-id>
pi-hub mcp-pool     # run the pooled MCP socket daemon
pi-hub config get
pi-hub config set session-prelude '<shell snippet>'
pi-hub config unset session-prelude
```

`add --add-cwd` creates a multi-repo session: `cwd` stays the primary repo, extra paths are symlinked into a per-session workspace, and Pi starts from that workspace. `delete` stops the tmux session if it is still alive, removes the registry row, removes the heartbeat file, and removes any owned multi-repo workspace. Pi conversation/session files and source repos are kept.
