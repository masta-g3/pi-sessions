# pi-command-center Agent Notes

- Keep this package Pi-native and small; do not import Agent Deck architecture unless explicitly requested.
- TUI rendering must remain pure and testable. Any ANSI styling must be width-safe through the theme/layout helpers.
- For Skills/MCP project state, write the final selection once. Do not launch parallel per-item JSON read-modify-write updates.
- Clipboard support is optional best-effort; attach/switch flows must still display the exact tmux command.
