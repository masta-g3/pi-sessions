# pi-agent-hub Configuration

This page covers runtime state, global config, themes, Skills, and MCP configuration. For dashboard usage, see [Features](FEATURES.md).

## Runtime state

- Global state: `PI_AGENT_HUB_DIR` or `<PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR>/pi-agent-hub` or `~/.pi/agent/pi-agent-hub`
- Config: `config.json` (`skills.poolDirs`, `mcp.catalogPath`, optional managed-session `session.prelude`)
- Registry: `registry.json`
- Heartbeats: `heartbeats/<session-id>.json`
- Multi-repo workspaces: `workspaces/<session-id>`
- Recent repo history: `repo-history.json`
- Dashboard tmux session: `pi-agent-hub`
- Managed Pi tmux sessions: `pi-agent-hub-<first-12-session-id-chars>`
- Project skills: `<project>/.pi/skills`
- Project skill state: `<project>/.pi/sessions/skills.json`
- Project MCP state: `<project>/.pi/sessions/mcp.json`
- MCP catalog: `<global-state>/mcp.json` by default, configurable in `config.json`
- MCP pool socket: `<global-state>/pool/pool.sock`
- Temporary tmux return binding state: `return-key/active.json` and `return-key/previous.tmux`

## Global config

Optional global config lives at `config.json` under the global state directory:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "skills": {
    "poolDirs": [
      "~/.pi/agent/skills",
      "~/.pi/agent/pi-agent-hub/skills/pool"
    ]
  },
  "mcp": {
    "catalogPath": "~/.pi/agent/pi-agent-hub/mcp.json"
  },
  "session": {
    "prelude": "security show-keychain-info ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db >/dev/null 2>&1 || security unlock-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db"
  }
}
```

Use the CLI for common config changes:

```bash
pi-hub config get
pi-hub config set session-prelude '<shell snippet>'
pi-hub config unset session-prelude
```

## Session prelude

`session.prelude` is an optional shell snippet that runs before `pi` starts in every new, restarted, or forked managed session. It is useful for machine-local setup such as unlocking the macOS login keychain, starting an SSH agent, or loading `direnv`; do not store raw secrets in it.

Configure it without editing JSON manually:

```bash
pi-hub config set session-prelude 'security show-keychain-info ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db >/dev/null 2>&1 || security unlock-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db'
pi-hub config unset session-prelude
```

The dashboard itself and direct `pi-hub tui` runs do not run `session.prelude`.

## Skills configuration

If `skills.poolDirs` is omitted, `pi-agent-hub` uses `<global-state>/skills/pool`.

The `s` picker lists skills from these directories and writes the final project selection to:

```text
<project>/.pi/sessions/skills.json
```

`<project>` is the selected session's primary cwd, or the TUI/dashboard current working directory when no session is selected.

## MCP configuration

Available MCP servers come from the configured catalog path or `<global-state>/mcp.json` by default.

Example catalog:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "servers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "mcp-filesystem",
      "args": ["."],
      "pool": false
    }
  }
}
```

Enable per project:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "enabledServers": ["filesystem"]
}
```

The `m` picker writes project MCP state for the selected session's primary cwd, or the TUI/dashboard current working directory when no session is selected:

```text
<project>/.pi/sessions/mcp.json
```

In multi-repo sessions, Skills/MCP state applies to the primary repo only; the runtime workspace exposes that state through its `.pi` symlink.

Servers with `pool: true` require `pi-hub mcp-pool`; they are not started automatically.

```bash
pi-hub mcp-pool
```

## Theme behavior

The standalone TUI reads Pi settings from the current project first (`.pi/settings.json`), then global Pi settings (`~/.pi/agent/settings.json` or `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/settings.json`). Custom themes are loaded from `.pi/themes/<name>.json` or `<agent-dir>/themes/<name>.json`.

While open, the dashboard periodically reloads that same Pi theme state and updates its ANSI colors when tokens change, so Pi theme changes from tools such as `pi-theme-sync` are reflected without restarting the dashboard.

Built-in Pi theme names `light` and `dark` map to compact theme token maps. Missing or invalid custom themes fall back to the built-in dark token map. Dashboard tmux status/footer chrome is configured separately; dashboard and managed-session tmux status bars are refreshed from the same loaded theme while the dashboard is running.
